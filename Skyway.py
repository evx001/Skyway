        SKYWAY

										-I-

 

The girl

(who would become known to herself as “the missing girl”)

sleeps,

    head slumped against the passenger window of the blue Honda

           rushing along the I-5 Skyway.

 

In the girl's dream:
she is in the bedroom 
of a composite house pulled together from bits of others they've already lived in; 
the girl grabs the angel-figurine from the nativity-set on the bedroom bureau just before a disembodied arm sweeps the entire set into a garbage bag.

“We don't have time, we've got to go. Now."

says a disembodied mother like voice.

										* * * * * * *

The blue Honda hits the railing

and the girl is jolted up through dream layers absently touching at the mark on her forehead,

like when she rode the Whirlygig ride at the Johnson County fair, last summer, 
the summer before they'd had to move again, 
in the middle of the night, always . . . 
the middle of the night.

 

The blue Honda launches out of the southbound lane of the I-5 Skyway

        into open space above treetops.

Hours later, against a blue dawn sky, right at the gap in the railing where the car went over; State-Trooper Marlowe will look down into a clump of shattered pine trees and mashed blue metal, that used to be a Honda Civic, (identifiable, only by the name-plate on the trunk) and fill out his accident report.

 

												-III-

 

Earth and sky change places for the girl in the blue Honda,

in a tumble,      

like laundry in a cold dryer

               

Air,
rushes in,
across her cheek,
Air,
from an open door.
Air
from a missing door. 
“Mom?”

											-IV-

“Thrown” seven yards in a “south easterly direction” from the “crash site” State Trooper Marlowe's report will say in triplicate.

											-V-

But the girl

isn't thinking of reports,

or last summer,

or amusement-park rides.

 

She’s touching at the mark, a dent, a divit, 
(her central defect)
on her forehead;

It’s like she’s crossing herself
but she isn’t crossing herself,
she’s flailing

screaming
or dreams screaming,
screaming in her mind,
screaming in her heart,
but hearts can't scream, 
						can they?

. . . and down the blue Honda Civic rolls, & twists, through pine branches, disgorging its driver, enfolding its passenger,

as it impacts the night
						-earth.

											-VI-

3am 

the median 

under the Route 5 Skyway in the Crown-Vic’ patrol-car Trooper Marlowe,

his face illuminated, blue by dashboard light.

Night air and night sounds enter through the open car window.

Outside, wind draws up angry, 
								sudden.

Sound follows the wind;

the sound of metal,

ri
pp
ing,

tear ing,

 

An engine races to scream.

tree-wood shatters, 

as if struck by a canon.

 

A something hits the tree row below the I-5 Skyway.

Trooper Marlow leaves his spot on the median

          police-lights on, siren on.

Heart racing,

          Marlow approaches, slow.

Fearful of running over the injured?

He must push through his 3am fog bank.

On the North side of 390,

          where it crosses under the Skyway,

a pine tree: 
sheared in two 
				by the “probable” remains 
of a vehicle 
			 pulled apart 
			 into toffee-like strands.

Seconds balloons to minutes, he moves as if underwater

unable to make his limbs move faster striding up the embankment to the disemboweled wreckage.

In the stillness: 
				the ticking steam of antifreeze on scalding exhaust.

 What can’t be in Trooper Marlowe’s report 
(but should be): 
	the time taken for him to find “the mother,” 
	in tall grass.
		Convulsing, 
		limbs expanding, 
		mouth, 
			blood-frothing.

The top of the woman's head, (inches above the eye line) sheared off.

He looks down into her sightless eyes; 
he tilts his head trying to imagine the sequence of events that puts her here.
  
Over his shoulder, 
a girl, 
(or the “sense” of a girl) 
					floating 
							above the accident 
looking down 
			at him, 
			but when he 
			looks up he can’t see anything
just a night full of winter stars.


Compelled, he turns away from the woman and goes back to the wreckage.

To look around,
				To look underneath,
										To look within.
Beneath the car-roof curled like a blanket,
engulfing 
			the only remaining occupant.
Visible? 
			A blood soaked knit cap with raccoon ears.

A hand emerges from under metal, 
a girl's hand, 
small 
open 
	extending toward him.

He touches the palm;

					feels the warmth.
The small hand closes tight around his fingers.

the girl on the edge of America: 
held in angel arms, warm as the wind in her face; she is moving toward the light surrounded by darkness;

 

the girl on the edge of America: 
sees herself little and dancing, on the pier at  Cayuga Lake, only to fall in the water, laughing;

 

the girl on the edge of America: 
sees a blank faced man who is either her father or a man who will be;

 

the girl on the edge of America: 
is about to slip out of America, float-away, forever or maybe 
																come back.
