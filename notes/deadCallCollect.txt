dead call collect a katheryn dhare mystery

we drove up from new york, in catherine's car, to essex bay.
there were precise instructions, we drove up to the big house.
we parked on the street and we walked around to the rear entrance so as to avoid the help.
in the shadows a figure loomed, he abruptly stepped out into the light brandishing a pistol.
i nearly let out a screen, fortunately catherine her reserved manner prevented us from escalating the scene.
"what's your business"  demanded the man waving his pistol.
seeing it was just two women he relaxed some.
"rosebud" said catherine.
there might've been others watching just out of sight.
it was as though we were entering a fortress.
down behind us we're some cliffs that looked out on to essex bay,
terrace surrounded the rear of the house i could imagine folks spending hours
relaxing on this back porch listening to the sound the waves crashing  bellow.
climb the steps to the glassed in terrace,
the breeze off the bay taking the edge off the heat off a high summer evening.
