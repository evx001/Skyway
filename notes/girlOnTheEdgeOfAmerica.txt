WomanOnTheEdgeOfAmerica

. . . running on the beach, a woman, a young woman, middle twenties -- hair pulled back in a pony-tail  -- working out? -- training for a marathon? -- She looks back behind her, back along the beach and up toward the dunes  to where the boardwalk snakes between berms -- she is bare footed -- the shore is rocky -- she should be wearing shoes. 

Night falls, the sun slipping behind the barrens, red-orange swollen -- night is almost . . .  
She dips below sight line, disappearing from view as the beach slopes away from the boardwalk. Has she fallen? Is she trying not to be seen? 

Katheryn Dhare from her vantage point, near the pavilion looks along the beach ahead to where the woman should reemerge and become visible again but it takes too long, too many beats pass. The woman must have fallen or collapsed. Katheryn runs down the boardwalk to where the stairs lead down to the beach proper. She kicks off her heels, and hikes up her skirt and leaps down on to the sand. The sand, wet and cold from a recent rain; chills her feet, but spurs her onward.
